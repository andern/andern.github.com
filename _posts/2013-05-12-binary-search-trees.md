In 1736, Leonhard Euler's paper
_Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis_ was published.
The paper describes the historical problem of the
[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg).
Put shortly, the problem was to find a walk through the city that would cross
each of the seven bridges only once. Euler proved in his paper that the problem
has no solution, and the paper is considered the first paper in graph theory,
and Euler is therefore considered the founder of graph theory
(Biggs, Lloyd, Wilson, 1986).
