# <a id="history"></a>Brief History
In 1736, Leonhard Euler's paper
*Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis*
(*eng:* The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) was
published.
The paper described the famous problem of the
[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg][1].
Put shortly, the problem was to find a walk through the city that would cross
each of the seven bridges only once. Euler proved in his paper that the problem
had no solution.
The paper is considered the first paper in graph theory (although the term
*graph* was not introduced until 1878, by the English mathematician James
Joseph Sylvester (Sylvester, 1878)) and Euler is therefore considered
the founder of graph theory (Biggs, Lloyd, Wilson, 1986).

More than a century after Euler's paper, British mathematician Arthur Cayley
started studying a particular class of graphs, namely trees. The term *tree*
was coined by Cayley himself in 1857 (Cayley, 1857).
