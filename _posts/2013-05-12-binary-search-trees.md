# Brief History
In 1736, Leonhard Euler's paper
*Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis* was published.
The paper described the historical problem of the
[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg).
Put shortly, the problem was to find a walk through the city that would cross
each of the seven bridges only once. Euler proved in his paper that the problem
had no solution. The paper is considered the first paper in graph theory,
and Euler is therefore considered the founder of graph theory
(Biggs, Lloyd, Wilson, 1986).

More than a century after Euler's paper, British mathematician Arthur Cayley
started studying a particular class of graphs, namely trees. The term *tree*
was coined by Cayley, and the term *graph* was **later** introduced by James
Joseph Sylvester in 1878.
